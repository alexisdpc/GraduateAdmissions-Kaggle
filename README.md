## Predicting Graduate Admissions using Deep Learning

This is a basic example on how to implement Neural Networks for predictions. \
We use tha Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions

The datasetcontains several parameters which are considered important during the application for Masters Programs.We construct a Neural Network that predicts the probability of getting admitted.

We optimize the learning rate by selecting the value that minimizes the loss:

This is a comparison of the model predictions with the true values:
