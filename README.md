## Predicting Graduate Admissions using Deep Learning

This is a simple example on how to implement Neural Networks for predictions. \
We use tha Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions

The dataset contains several parameters which are considered important during the application for Masters Programs.\
We construct a Neural Network that predicts the probability of getting admitted.
